# IITC plugin: Magnus builder tracker

Track your progress in for Magnus builder/architect badge.

This plugin allows manual entry of deployed, unique resonators.

<del>It will also try to guess which resonators you have captured from portal details, but this will not catch every case</del>. Not working yet (cannot be sure when the resonators were deployed).

Use the `magnusBuilder` highlighter to show your progress on the map.
Use the `sync` plugin to share between multiple browsers or desktop/mobile.
