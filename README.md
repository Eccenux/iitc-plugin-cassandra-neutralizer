# IITC plugin: Magnus builder tracker

Track your progress in for Magnus builder/architect badge.

This plugin allows manual entry of deployed, unique resonators. It also allows selecting whole areas.

See also: [my other IITC plugins](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AEccenux+iitc-plugin&type=Repositories).

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have IITC just [install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-magnus-builder/raw/master/magnus-builder.user.js).

You should also install this plugins:
* [Sync](https://iitc.me/desktop/#plugin-sync) (Category: Misc) -- plugin used to share between multiple browsers or desktop/mobile.
* [draw tools](https://iitc.me/desktop/#plugin-draw-tools) (Category: Layer) -- plugin used to select many portals.

Note! On your mobile device install default `Sync` plugin, **but** install [my mobile friendly draw tools](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-draw-tools-mobile/blob/master/README.md). Default draw tools don't really work on mobile (touch) devices.

Basic usage
------------

Just open portal details and select resonators.

Use the `Magnus Builder` highlighter to show your progress on the map. Highlighters can be selected on the right side of the map (in desktop version of IITC) or in the right drawer (in mobile app).

Selecting many portals
------------------------

You can use draw tools to select many portals and quickly mark them as done. This also works great if you have problems clicking on two portals that are close together.

Note! You need `draw tools` plugin to use this feature.
